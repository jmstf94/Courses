For setting it up on your computer, please refer to the Forest documentation. At the time of writing, the simulator and the compiler were not open source. Here we spell out the details of Forest that are critical for the rest of the notebooks.\n",

We wrap this boilerplate code in a function that returns the process objects and a `ForestConnection` object containing the details of the ports."
